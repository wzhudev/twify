# Privacy Policy for TWIFY

Effective Date: March 18, 2025

Thank you for using TWIFY! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our Chrome extension.

## 1. Data Collection

At this time, TWIFY does not collect, store, or process any personal data from its users. Our extension is designed to function without gathering any information about you, such as your name, email address, browsing history, or any other personally identifiable information.

## 2. Use of LLM API Key and Endpoint

TWIFY allows you to provide an LLM API Key to access a Large Language Model (LLM) Endpoint of your choice. When you input your API Key and specify an LLM Endpoint, the extension facilitates direct requests from your device to the user-specified LLM Endpoint. We do not collect, store, or process your API Key or any data exchanged between your device and the LLM Endpoint. Additionally, TWIFY does not operate its own servers; all interactions with the LLM Endpoint occur locally on your device and are managed by you.

## 3. Data Usage

Since we do not collect any data, we do not use, share, or disclose any user information to third parties. The extension operates locally on your device to provide its intended functionality.

## 4. Permissions

TWIFY may request certain permissions to operate effectively. These permissions are limited to what is necessary for the extension’s features and do not involve collecting or transmitting your data. Any permissions requested are used solely to enhance your experience with the extension.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our extension or applicable laws. If we make significant changes, we will notify you through the extension or by updating the effective date at the top of this document. Please review this policy periodically for any updates.
